## Overview
This folder contains the code for the Machine Learning project. 
The MZI matrix is created and it is further decomposed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 
The unitary matrices thus obtained are further represented using MZI arrays.

## How to run
The codes can easily run using Jupyter Notebook.
