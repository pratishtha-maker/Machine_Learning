This is a machine learning library developed by Pratishtha Agnihotri for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah. 

Data.py file is to load data for both car and bank datasets
ID3.py explains the ID3 algorithm and its implementation
The features used are Information Gain (IG), Majority Error(ME) and Gini Index (GI).
# How to run for car dataset 

### python3 ID3.py car ig 1
### python3 ID3.py car me 1
### python3 ID3.py car gi 1
Here numerical value represents depth.

# How to run for bank dataset 
### python3 ID3.py bank ig 1
### python3 ID3.py bank me 1
### python3 ID3.py bank gi 1
Here numerical value represents depth.
